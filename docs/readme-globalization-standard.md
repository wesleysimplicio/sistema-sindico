## Benchmark Input

This README pattern was built after reviewing:

- [Lum1104/Understand-Anything](https://github.com/Lum1104/Understand-Anything), which had about 47.5k stars on 2026-06-01. It wins attention with a centered title, one-sentence category, language selector, badges, hero screenshot, live demo, quick start, multi-platform install, community link, under-the-hood section, and Star History chart.
- [microsoft/vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), [vercel/next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), [ollama/ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama), [supabase/supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase), [langchain-ai/langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), [rustdesk/rustdesk](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk), [ant-design/ant-design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design), and [open-webui/open-webui](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui), all above 50k stars in the current benchmark pull.

## Required README Order

1. Centered product title.
2. One strong promise in the first viewport.
3. Trust badges: GitHub stars, package version where applicable, language/runtime, license.
4. Language selector with the full Simplicio language set.
5. Real visual asset or chart, not decorative filler.
6. Project DNA: a short project-specific narrative that explains why this repo exists and what makes it real.
7. Quick Start before long architecture reference.
8. What it does, expressed as outcomes instead of internal implementation first.
9. Proof and validation: benchmarks, tests, mapper artifacts, smoke flow, or known blocker.
10. Simplicio ecosystem graph.
11. Documentation links.
12. Original project guide / Project DNA archive: restore the strongest pre-existing README material instead of replacing it.
13. Star History chart.
14. License / production note.

## Project-Specific Checklist

- Product: Sistema Sindico
- GitHub slug used by badges and Star History: `wesleysimplicio/sistema-sindico`
- Hero asset: none; Star History and Mermaid graph carry the visual layer for now
- Package surfaces: not package-published from this repo
- Primary quick-start command: `cp .env.example .env`

## Maintenance Rules

- A globalization pass must add discovery value without deleting the repo-specific operating manual. Keep benchmarks, setup notes, domain details, architecture explanations, screenshots, caveats, and reproduction commands unless they are false.
- Treat the centered hero, badges, language selector and Star History as the front door; treat the restored guide as the workshop. Both layers are required.
- Keep commands copy-pasteable and do not translate command flags.
- Keep the first paragraph localized in every language; deep reference docs may remain in English until a release needs full translation.
- Update this file whenever the README structure changes.
- If a badge, hero, Star History chart, or package link stops rendering, fix it before release.
- When the repo has a changelog or explicit version, a release-relevant README refresh gets a patch bump.
